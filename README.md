- ðŸ’­ Reflection:
> We were required to design a poster referring to a case. The case was : a man gave the officer RM1100 and reqeust the officer to help him get away from urine test (either let him go or help him to forge the urine test result). Hence, we discussed the cronology, the causes, and the impacts in this poster.
